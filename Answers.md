1. What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve? Support your answer with concepts introduced in class and from your personal research on the web.

React JS is a Javascript framework. Its use of components makes it the code clean and easier to use. It also helps with pages like Tumblr and Twitter, where the DOM changes frequently, so that the only parts changed are the ones that need it. Since it's changing only select components instead of the entire page, the page can render faster.
